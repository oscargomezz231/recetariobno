        <p style = "color: darkgreen"> Ingredients </ p>
        
        - 1/3 cup of water <p> </ p>
        - 1 package of baking yeast <p> </ p>
        - 1 tablespoon of sugar <p> </ p>
        - 1 1/3 cups of milk at time <p> </ p>
        - 3 1/2 cups of flour <p> </ p>
        - 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil <p> </ p>
        - 3 1/2 unsalted butter bars <p> </ p>
        - 1 piece of egg <p> </ p>
        - 2 tablespoons of cream <p> </ p>
        
        
        <p style = "color: darkgreen"> PREPARATION </ p> <p> </ p>
        
         In a small bowl, mix the water, the yeast and 1 tablespoon of sugar. Let stand for 5 minutes and make sure the yeast is reacting. <p> </ p>
        
        In another small deep bowl dissolve the remaining sugar and salt in the milk. <p> </ p>
        
        In a large bowl, add flour, milk, water with yeast and oil and mix with a wooden spatula. <p> </ p>
        
        On a surface with flour put the dough and knead with the hands changing side each time for 2-3 minutes. <p> </ p>
        
        
        Transfer the dough to a bowl, cover with plastic wrap and let it grow for about an hour and a half. The dough should double in size. <p> </ p>
        
        
       Re-knead the dough on a surface with flour for 2-3 minutes and put in a refractory and cover with plastic wrap. Let it sit for 45 minutes or if you prefer in the refrigerator for the entire night. <p> </ p>
        
        
        On a surface with flour make a butter base with a wooden spatula. This base should be about 3/4 the size of the flattened dough. <p> </ p>
        
        
        On another surface spread the dough with a baking roll. Put the butter on the dough and knead it to incorporate it 100%. Make a dough ball and cover with plastic wrap. Refrigerate for 1 hour. <p> </ p>
        
        
        Remove the dough from the refrigerator and with a roller form a rectangle of approximately 50 by 24 cms. If the butter is hard while flattening the dough it will melt. <p> </ p>
        
        
        Cut the rectangle in half and in each half make triangles, each triangle will be a little horn. <p> </ p>

        
       Preheat the oven to 220 degrees Celsius and roll each triangle towards the tip. <p> </ p>
        
        
       Put the little horns on baking trays with waxed paper underneath them and curl the edges of each little horn towards the center. <p> </ p>
        
        In a bowl whisk the egg yolk and the cream and with a brush paint the little horns so that they take a golden color. <p> </ p>
        
       
        Cook the horns for 15 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from the oven. <p> </ p>
