        <p style = "color: darkgreen"> PREPARATION: <p> </p>
        Pre-heat the oven to 180ÂºC. Separate 6 egg whites from different bowls. Beat 6 egg whites to nougat point with an electric mixer (it is very important that they remain on the nougat point before adding the other ingredients), once they are added, add the sugar little by little while continuing to beat. <p> </p>
        Beat the 6 yolks with a fork and add them to the mixture. Add the flour and milk and beat until a homogeneous mixture is left. <p> </p>
       Grease and flour the mold you will use. Empty the mixture of the cake in the mold so that it is 3/4 full. Put it in the oven for 30 to 40 minutes (without opening the oven, always watching it) or until a stick comes out clean. <p> </p>
        While it is being baked, mix in the blender or the blender the three milk (condensed milk, evaporated milk and cream) and one yolk (the white one should be reserved for the bitumen <p> </p>
        Once the cake is ready, remove it from the oven and while it is hot, sprinkle it with a fork on all sides and add the mixture of the three milks on top. <p> </p>
        For the meringue: Beat 3 egg whites until stiff once you are adding glass sugar little by little. <p> </p>
        Once the cake is completely cold, decorate the cake with the meringue and strawberries. <br>
