         <p style = "color: darkgreen"> Ingredients: <p> </p>
    
    - 3 cups of pineapple, chopped in cubes <p>
        
    - 1/4 cup of water <p>
         
    - 2-4 tablespoons of granulated sugar <p>
         
         <p style = "color: darkgreen"> DEVELOPMENT STEP BY STEP </p>
        
        1: Place the pieces of pineapple in the blender together with the water and blend with the "pulse" function about 3-4 times at intervals of 3 seconds each time. <p>
         
         2: Pour the pineapple in a small casserole, add the sugar and heat over medium-high heat until it starts to "boil". <p>
         
         3: Once it boils, continue cooking on low heat until it has a thick consistency. Make sure you move constantly with a spatula or spoon to avoid burning or caramelizing. <p>
         
         4: When it reaches the desired consistency, remove from heat and empty into a jar. Let cool and enjoy <p>

        The jam is kept covered in the refrigerator for up to 3 weeks. We finish it in two days but that is the time of life normally of a jam that has not been vacuum packed. <p>
The 3 pineapple cups came out of a small pineapple, if your pineapple is very large, just adjust the amount of sugar. <p>
         
The pineapple I used was so sweet that I only needed 2 tablespoons of sugar. I recommend using a pineapple as ripe and sweet as possible, so you avoid large amounts of "unnatural" sugar. <p>
         
Depending on the power of your mixer, you may have to adjust the times or the times you liquefy it. The important thing is that it is not like jelly, you want that there are still pieces of pineapple of an acceptable size and at the same time you also want the pineapple to release a bit of its juice. <p> <p>
