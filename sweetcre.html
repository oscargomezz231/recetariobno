   - 250 milliliters of milk <p> </ p>
   - 2 eggs <p> </ p>
   - 100 grams of wheat flour <p> </ p>

    <p style = "color: darkgreen"> PREPARATION </ p> <p> </ p>
    
    
     Blend milk with eggs, flour, sugar and vanilla until you have a homogeneous mixture. <p> </p>
    
    
     Melt a little butter in a skillet over medium-high heat and pour approximately 4 tablespoons of the dough. Move the pan to cover the entire bottom with the dough, forming a very thin layer, and cook for 2 to 4 minutes, turning once, until they look slightly golden brown. <p> </p>
    
    Repeat the procedure until the mass is finished. Serve immediately or freeze, separating the crepas with each other with paper <p> </p>
